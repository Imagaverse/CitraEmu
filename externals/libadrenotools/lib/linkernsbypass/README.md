### Android Linker Namespace Bypass Library
Provides access to the hidden linker namespace functionality in Android 9+ and exposes an interface for hooking libraries similar to a runtime equivalent of `LD_PRELOAD`.  
See the `android_linker_ns.h` header for an API reference.

#### Support
Android 9+  
Arm64  
  
Android 8 and arm32 could be supported with some trivial changes, feel free to open an issue if you have a use for this library on either of them.
